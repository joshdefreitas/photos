**Hi, I'm Josh De Freitas!**

I'm an amateur photographer with a passion for capturing the beauty of the world around me. My photography is inspired by nature's tranquility. I enjoy capturing the serene beauty of forests, mountains, and coastlines. I also enjoy experimenting with different photography techniques and sharing my work with others. I believe that photography is a powerful tool for storytelling and connecting with people.
